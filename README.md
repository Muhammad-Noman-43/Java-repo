# Hello, I'm Muhammad Noman
Welcome to the great list of common and simple example lab tasks I had done in my OOP course at COMSATS University Abbotabad. These files might come handy when working on this
course at a beginner level. Leave your best regards at muhammadnoman.cs@gmail.com. I'll be happy to look forward to thanksgiving email.
